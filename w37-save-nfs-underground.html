Most racing games today have seemingly forgotten this I feel. I used to love the concept of boosting in racing games because it was an added dynamic.

Some of you appears to be wanting to jump ships. So to help you decide, I shall make a side by side comparison of the 2 games: Graphics: Needless to say, both games look amazing, NL is more dark and gritty to befit the underground theme while Asphalt 9 is more bright and colourful. Cars: Being a younger game, Asphalt 9 has only 48 cars compared to No Limit's 71 cars. Cars are divided into 5 classes like in A8 and AX. For D class. 
The perspective I believe that a review's important part isn't only about the game, but making it clear who writes the review, where his thoughts come from. After I stopped pirating games more than a decade ago (25 right now), the single genre I did not buy myself into was racing for a very, very long time, and what broke the ice was The Crew. The games I wanted a good successor for were NFS: Underground series, Most Wanted - the first one - and Carbon that I wholehearedly loved Hey r/sneakers, this is my first official guide to copping the Sean Wotherspoon x Nike Air Max 97s.

Worked fine, except when I tried to save it. There were no save options in the game and when I turn off my Gameboy Advance, and start up NFS again, it did not save and told me to create a new profile. I tried blowing into the cartridge, and I have tried turning it off and on multiple times and played a few levels. Can anyone.

Hey Guys! First time making a post here. Bought things from some of you but never sold so I'm starting off small to build some rep. Not Bad games at all just not the top shelf stuff. I'll save that for when I'm a higher tier.  I have played each and every one of these at some point so I know they work but I haven't tested some of them recently. If theres any problems let me know I'll fix it. I have no reason to believe any of them aren't perfectly fine. These are from my personal collection.

Need For Speed Pro Street was probably the most underrated Need For Speed in the franchise. My concept of Prostreet 2 implements parts of the original Prostreet, some aspects of local racing leagues, track days, real-life racing series. I will go in depth with this concept so bear with me. CAREER MODE: In the Original ProStreet, you are Ryan Cooper, a former street racer gone legal. One thing I disliked about the plot in ProStreet was the fact the career mode lacked a good prologue.you.
